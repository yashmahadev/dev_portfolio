```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Customizing Content

There are two ways to customize your portfolio content:

### 1. Edit the JSON file directly

Modify the file at `src/data/portfolio-data.json`.

### 2. Use the built-in Data Editor

1. Start both the development server and API server:
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/editor

3. Make your changes in the editor

4. Click "Save Changes" to update your content

## Data Structure

The portfolio data is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "hero": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "Your Title",
    ...
  },
  "about": {
    "title": "About Me",
    "subtitle": "Your subtitle",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

See the editor guide for a complete breakdown of the data structure.

## Deployment

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

2. Deploy the `dist` directory to your hosting provider.

For the data API in production:
- Set up the API server on your hosting provider
- Update the API_URL in the DataEditor component to point to your production API
- Add authentication to secure the API endpoints

## Adding Authentication (Optional)

For production use, consider adding authentication to the data editor:

1. Implement a login page
2. Add authentication middleware to the API routes
3. Protect the editor route with a route guard
